Description: Power network extension to QLandkarteGT
 This package provides a versatile tool for GPS maps in GeoTiff format as
 well as Garmin's img vector map format. QLandkarteGT is the successor of
 QLandkarte. Among various improvements (e.g. 2D/3D map rendering and
 reduced resource demands) the major difference is its
 device-independent architecture, which is not limited to Garmin devices
 anymore. Therefore, the package also does not include device drivers.
 Drivers for a number of Garmin devices are available from the
 qlandkartegt-garmin package.
 .
 Additionally, QLandkarteGT serves as a frontend to the GDAL tools, to
 make georeferencing of scanned maps feasible for users. In contrast to
 similar tools (e.g. QGis) its straightforward interface is especially
 suited for non-scientific users.
 .
 The power network extension enables calculation of simple electric power 
 distribution networks. Please note that only stand-alone networks and small
 outputs (< 100kW> are suppported.
